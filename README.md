Radiant Stereotype Extension
===

About
---

An extension by [Aissac][aissac] that adds templating support to [Radiant CMS][radiant].

Tested on Radiant 0.7.1 and 0.8.
 
Features
---

* Define named templates (stereotypes) for Pages;
* Templates are assigned per-parent Page, making all children have the defined 'stereotype' by their parent;
* You can specify the new page's parts, filters, layout, page type and status.

Instalation
---

Stereotype Extension has one dependency, the [Radiant Custom Fields Extension][rcfe].

    git submodule add git://github.com/Aissac/radiant-custom-fields-extension.git vendor/extensions/custom_fields

Because Stereotype Extension keeps the settings in the `Radiant::Config` table it is highly recommended to install the [Settings Extension][rse]
  
    git submodule add git://github.com/Squeegy/radiant-settings.git vendor/extensions/settings
    
Finally, install the [Stereotype Extension][rste]

    git submodule add git://github.com/Aissac/radiant-stereotype-extension.git vendor/extensions/stereotype
    
###Note

To get the Radiant 0.7.1 version tag you need to:

    cd vendor/extensions/custom_fields/
    git checkout v0.7
    
Configuration
---

To add stereotypes you need to add fields to the Radiant::Config table. There are three types of settings for each stereotype:

1.) Page Parts (and filters)

The key has to look like: `stereotype.<name_of_the_stereotype>.parts` and the value `body:markdown,sidebar:textile`.

2.) Layout

The key has to look like: `stereotype.<name_of_the_stereotype>.layout` and the value has to be the name of a layout (case sensitive)

3.) Page type

The key should look like: `stereotype.<name_of_the_stereotype>.page_type` and the value has to be a valid `class_name` attribute of the Page class. (Examples: ArchivePage, FileNotFoundPage or ArchiveMonthIndexPage)

4.) Status

The key has to look like: `stereotype.<name_of_stereotype>.status` and the value has to be a valid `status` attribute of the page: draft, hidden, reviewed, published

Usage
---

1.) Add stereotypes as described in the configuration section.

2.) Edit/create a new page that has children and select a stereotype from the dropdown labeled "Stereotype". Child pages added to this page will be created with their attributes set by default to the fields you configured.

3.) ...

4.) Profit!
